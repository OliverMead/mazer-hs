# mazer-hs
This project is to replace [OliverMead/mazer](https://github.com/OliverMead/mazer)
- a project I started in C.
I believe that functional programming is better suited to this task, so I am
using Haskell.
## Building
This project uses the [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/build_command/) build system.
